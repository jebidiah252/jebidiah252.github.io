        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Gordon Fjeldsted, and I'm a <strong>proud cat dad!</strong>
        Oh, I'm also a masters student at Utah State University as well. I enjoy gaming when I'm 
        not working at Space Dynamics Lab or working on my masters degree. My favorite games to play are 
        Magic: the Gathering, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Bioshock. For a small time, I also
        invested in M:tG cards (I no longer do this as the investment was incredibly volatile). I was able to 
        earn around <span id="cha-ching"><strong>$7,000</strong></span> on my investment during the pandemic!
